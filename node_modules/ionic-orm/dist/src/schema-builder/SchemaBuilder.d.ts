 * Creates complete tables schemas in the database based on the entity metadatas.

 * 1. load list of all tables with complete column and keys information from the db
 * 2. drop all (old) foreign keys that exist in the table, but does not exist in the metadata
 * 3. create new tables that does not exist in the db, but exist in the metadata
 * 4. drop all columns exist (left old) in the db table, but does not exist in the metadata
 * 5. add columns from metadata which does not exist in the table
 * 6. update all exist columns which metadata has changed
 * 7. update primary keys - update old and create new primary key from changed columns
 * 8. create foreign keys which does not exist in the table yet
 * 9. create indices which are missing in db yet, and drops indices which exist in the db, but does not exist in the metadata anymore
