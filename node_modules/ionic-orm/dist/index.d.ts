 * - TYPEORM_SUBSCRIBERS - list of directories containing subscribers to load. Should be string - directory names (can be patterns) split by a comma.
 * - TYPEORM_ENTITY_SCHEMAS - list of directories containing entity schemas to load. Should be string - directory names (can be patterns) split by a comma.
 * - TYPEORM_NAMING_STRATEGIES - list of directories containing custom naming strategies to load. Should be string - directory names (can be patterns) split by a comma.
